I've always been a huge cricket fanatic. I used to read a lot of cricket commentary and i still do, not just for the match updates, but because some of the commentary was pure gold. The way commentators slip in crazy idioms, excellent phrases, and just the perfect words at the perfect time always amazed me.  

At some point, I thought why not make AI do that based on my prompt?
